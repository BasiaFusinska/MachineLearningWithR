# Tuning your algorithm is a complex and iterative task.
# In this task you will tune your model and then use it to predict values on the test set.
# Tasks to perform:
# - Split the iris dataset to the training and test data (90% in the training set)
# - Perform repeated 5-fold cross validation (3x)
# - Use Naive Bayes as your algorithm
# - Tune the algorithm providing the grid of 3 distinct sets of parameters values
# - Check how does the model perform on the validation test set (note that the algorithm is predicting the probabilities)
# Additional task:
# - How would you perform k-NN algorithm for k=7 that is trained on the whole training set?
