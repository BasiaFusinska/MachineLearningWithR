# Once you know your data you could start a task of classifying them.
# You would be using two algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbours and Logistic Regression
# To do this you need to perform few tasks:
# - Prepare the data if needed (hint: some algorithms need the data to be normalised before beeing fed to the training phase, otherwise some of the dimensions can overtake)
# - Split the data to train and test (75% in the training set)
# - Perform training using both k-Nearest Neighbours and Logistic Regression (don't worry about parameters tuning for now)
# - Check the performance of both classificator on the training and test sets
# - Visualise the classification results and underlying truth
