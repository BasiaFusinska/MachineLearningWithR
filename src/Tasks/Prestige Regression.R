# Given the information you've gathered when exploring Prestige dataset 
# you should have pretty good idea about the features.
# Your task is now to perform linear regression and evaluate your algorithm.
# Experiment with the lm formula, check relevant statistics and plots:
# - Include all numeric features
# - Use function for the variables that have other than linear relation with the prestige 
# - Include and check what happens when you add categorical feature
# - Try combining the features or conditional features (use multiplication in the formula)
